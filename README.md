## Junior Test Project

- The junior test project but this time instead of using React for frontend it is all in PHP . 

- The code is structured similar to a MVC framework, the 'views' is responsible for generating the user interface. 

- It uses bootstrap and also some custom styling. 

## To start the application 
- RUN 'docker compose up' in the root folder to start the application.
    - The application is running on localhost:8000

- It is possible that when initially loaded it will throw a PDOException error, because the database hasn't connected yet, but that should resolve itself in 30 seconds to a minute.
